## 2026-08-08 — repository created, layout validated before any code

**Attempted.** Stand up the v2 repository skeleton and prove the pieces fit
together before writing a line of implementation.

**Works.** `tools/validate_layout.py` runs clean-ish (see below). 541 EARS
requirements across three spec files parse, IDs are unique, every statement
carries a binding SHALL, SHOULD appears nowhere, the index count matches disk,
and the constitution's rule numbers are contiguous. `tools/test_guard.sh`
exercises the destructive-command hook against 25 real command strings: 23
behave as specified.

**Does not work.** Three subsystem specs remain unwritten (REQ-ONT, REQ-WKT,
REQ-BOD, REQ-SLP, REQ-CTX, REQ-NFR, REQ-UI). No schema, no code, no tests
beyond the two harnesses above. Two guard-hook findings open — see
OPEN_QUESTIONS OQ-14 and OQ-15.

**Requirement IDs touched.** None — no implementation this session.

**Commit.** (pending first commit)
